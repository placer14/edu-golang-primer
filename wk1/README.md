# Week 1: First Principles

## Before class

1. Install Go on your local host.
    1. go.dev recommends installing from tarball, but `brew install go` and
    `apt install -y golang-go` work fine.
2. Write/run a quick "Hello World" on your local host: [Getting Started][getting-started]
    1. If you are unable to complete this, please get help from the Internet
    or the instructor.
    2. In a pinch, the [Go Playground][golang-playground] will suffice for this task.
3. Walk through the [Go Tour][golang-tour] and play around with the examples.

## Topics Covered

- Go Types
- Language keywords and operators
- Control Flow

## Homework

1. Review content in the [Go Tour][golang-tour] some more and play around with
the examples.
2. Capture anything which is unclear to be asked at the next session.
3. Read the following pages within [gobyexample.com][gobyexample]
    1. <https://gobyexample.com/values>
    2. <https://gobyexample.com/variables>
    3. <https://gobyexample.com/constants>
    4. <https://gobyexample.com/functions>
    5. <https://gobyexample.com/multiple-return-values>
    6. <https://gobyexample.com/closures>
    7. <https://gobyexample.com/recursion>
    8. <https://gobyexample.com/for>
    9. <https://gobyexample.com/if-else>
    10. <https://gobyexample.com/switch>
    11. <https://gobyexample.com/strings-and-runes>
    12. <https://gobyexample.com/string-functions>
        1. Think about the declaration of `p` in this example. If we were
        to do this in production, what might be some good reasons for and/or
        against this? (Steelman and strawman this pattern.) Be prepared to
        discuss your position at the beginning of this week's session.
