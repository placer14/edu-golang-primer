# Week 1: First Principles

## Before class

0. Install Go on your local host.
    1. go.dev recommends installing from tarball, but `brew install go` and `apt install -y golang-go` work fine.
1. Write/run a quick "Hello World" on your local host: [Getting Started][getting-started]
    1. If you are unable to complete this, please get help from the Internet or the instructor.
    2. In a pinch, the [Go Playground][golang-playground] will suffice for this task.
2. Walk through the [Go Tour][golang-tour] and play around with the examples.

## Topics Covered

- Go Types
- Language keywords and operators
- Control Flow

## Homework

1. Review content in the [Go Tour][golang-tour] some more and play around with the examples.
2. Capture anything which is unclear to be asked at the next session.
